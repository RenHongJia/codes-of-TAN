# codes-of-TAN
Implementation of TAN algorithm by python and its Application in Geoscience

Experimental environment
==========
OS: Windows 7

Memory：8G

IDE：Pycharm professional 2018

Dependencies
==========
The code is written Python  language and IDE is  Pycharm 2018.
When running code in pycharm, the following dependent libraries are required:
- Python 3.4 or higher
- NetworkX 2.x
- Scipy 
- Numpy

- pgmpy

TAN (Tree Augmented Bayesian network) 
==========
In the model folder is the TAN algorithm written in Python 3.7 

Examples 
==========
Code 1.py and code2.py are the source code of the case study mentioned in the article "Spatial prediction of oil and gas distribution using Tree Augmented Bayesian network".

Running code
==========
The example is provided in the documentation, one can easily test the example . 
First to run code1.py file in IDE pycharm, and get the TAN network structure ,
then run in code2.py in IDE pycharm, get the TAN network structure under the guidance of experts ,
