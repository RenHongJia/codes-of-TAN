# codes-of-TAN
Implementation of TAN algorithm by python and its Application in Geoscience

Experimental environment
===========
OS: Windows 7

Memory：8G

IDE：Pycharm professional 2018

Dependencies
==========
The code is written Python  language and IDE is  Pycharm 2018.
When running code in pycharm, the following dependent libraries are required:
- Python 3.4 or higher
- NetworkX 2.x
- Scipy 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- pgmpy

TAN (Tree Augmented Bayesian network) 
==========
In the model folder is the TAN algorithm written in Python 3.7 

Instruction
==========
Because real data is proprietary, so we replace real data with simulated data. 
The TAN algorithm in the model folder can be used to model the simulation data to simulate the application in geoscience
